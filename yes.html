        <h1>YEY HAPPY VALENTINES BABY!</h1>💕
    <p>I love you.
Thank you for choosing me every single day, even when loving me isn’t always easy.

I know I’m not perfect. I know there are times when I can be stubborn and make choices I shouldn’t like drinking more than I should. I’m sorry for the times I’ve worried you or disappointed you.

Please know that I’m trying, and I want to be better — not just for you, but for us.
You mean so much to me, and I never want to take that for granted.

Thank you for your patience, your understanding, and your love.
Distance is hard, but loving you makes it worth it. 💕  

I miss you so much, and I can’t wait until we’re finally together.</p>
